Growth begins the moment you choose curiosity over comfort.
Even the smallest light can guide you through the darkest night.
Courage isn’t the absence of fear, but the decision to move forward despite it.
Dreams whisper truths your doubts try to silence.
Kindness is a seed; even the tiniest act can bloom into a forest of hope.
